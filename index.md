## CA Electricity Prices
### Mar 7th, 2022

  As of 2022, California homeowners pay around 20 cents for the kilowatt hour for household electricity. Unlike CA, most Midwest and Southern state energy prices are significantly less, with Tennessee prices hovering around a low 10 cents per kilowatt hours. In terms of yearly costs, a CA homeowner paying $200 per month for electricity pays $2,400 per year, twice more than Tennessee. Reasonably, it is clear why so many homeowners are frustrated with energy prices that continue to rise. Especially considering the inflation impacts of COVID-19 over the past two years, energy prices have continued to skyrocket. Solar offers a promising solution. After CA solar tax credits, the average solar panel installation cost is around $10,000. Over a 20 year period, installing solar has the potential to save over $50,000 when all utility costs, inflation, and incentives are considered. California also offers the greatest solar incentives out of any state in the United States. (via the [US Department of Energy](https://www.energysage.com/local-data/solar-panel-cost/ca/#))
  
With the unpredictable world we live in today, solar panels offer an inflation-proof solution to the energy problem. 
In fact, over the past 10 years, residential solar panel prices have gone down by 64% illustrated by the graph below from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

![The cost of solar continues to decline across residential, commercial, and utility-scale PV systems, driven largely by increased module efficiency as well as lowered hardware and inverter costs.](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/images/pv-2up-825.jpg)

Not only is solar inflation-proof, it has the potential to DECREASE in price even further, a strategy no CA homeowner should miss.
